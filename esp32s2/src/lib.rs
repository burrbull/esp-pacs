/*!Peripheral access API for ESP32-S2 microcontrollers (generated using svd2rust v0.33.3 ( ))

You can find an overview of the generated API [here].

API features to be included in the [next] svd2rust release can be generated by cloning the svd2rust [repository], checking out the above commit, and running `cargo doc --open`.
